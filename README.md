# Project Overview

**Fission 4 Answers** is an interactive science quiz game, intended as general knowledge, with a mixture of question difficulty. We have provided 4 game modes for players. All questions, Chemistry, Physics or Biology. 

View the [Deployed Site](https://rowan01g.github.io/Fission-for-Answers/)

### Project Goal
The overall project goal was to create an interactive quiz website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. While utlising tools such as AI, to enhance design and debugging, inline with the [marking crtieria](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:CodeInstitute+FSBC_H1AI+1/courseware/8765212c3d0c4f9ca95ce2e6de9ae626/5a0e79ed85344b13887067937f5d27b6/).

And here are the specifics 


# Features

## Existing Features 
- Interactive quiz, with immediate correct/incorrect feedback.

- A 'light mode' toggle, with accessible colours for players who may be visually impaired.

# Design 


### Colour scheme 

We chose a dark background colour scheme to align with the space theme of the hero image, icons and buttons. Specifically these were:
![base colour scheme used on Quiz](/assets/images/readme/base-colours.png)

The following colours were used to create a changing gradient glow effect on the hero image.

## UX

## Planning

### User Stories 

User stories were generated with the assistance of AI (namely, Copilot). Prompts were ammended and answers fine tuned to meet the project criteria in view of time contraints.

### Project Board 

User stories were turned into 'Issues' on a project board, allowing syncronous group work and clear allocation of tasks which assisted in iliciting minimal merge conflicts. 

![fission for answers group project board](/assets/images/readme/project-board.png)

#### Group Working 

We had frequent check ins, and worked in serperate branches. We also focused on different areas of the project. 
We compared and ensured no merge conflicts between our branch and the main before pushing changes.

## Documentation 

### Code Organisation

The code in this project was organised into defined sections (including seperate files for the different languages). Files were named appropriately, consistently and (to us) obviously.



## Validation and testing 

The website is intented to be accessible to all (within reason). Therefore validation and testing of both the code and final project design was completed to ensure best practise of accessibility and user experience.

## Usage 

Fission 4 Answers is designed for recreational and educarional usage, for those who wish to test or improve their science knowledge. This is not designed to align with any curriculum. 

** Maybe include a little video/walk through tutorial if there's any time? **

# AI Tools 

AI was utilised in this project in serveral areas. 

### Debugging:

### Code Optimisation:

### Reflection on the use of AI in this project:

The use of AI has allowed this project to be created in a more timely manner. AI for **debugging** helped to identify small errors and typos which would have taken considerably longer if done by hand (or eye?).
<br>
In **code optimisation**, AI was able to suggest areas in which the code could be made shorter/more effective, and suggest alternative work-arounds for design. This was most appropriate in the CSS and HTML of the wesbite, as JavaScript information tended to be less reliable, although a useful tool nonetheless. 
<br>
Finally, AI was a useful tool in the intial planning stage, such as in the generation and optimisation of the [User Stories](#user-stories). AI was also used to suggest initial **code generation**, to give an idea of where to start - although this was not used in the final project.
