# Project Overview

**Fission 4 Answers** is an interactive sciece quiz game, intended for players of varying knowledge with adjustable difficulties. We have provided a high score cache for players to compete with themselves or each other.

### Project Goal
The overall project goal was to create an interactive quiz website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. While utlising tools such as AI, to enhance design and debugging, inline with the [marking crtieria](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:CodeInstitute+FSBC_H1AI+1/courseware/8765212c3d0c4f9ca95ce2e6de9ae626/5a0e79ed85344b13887067937f5d27b6/).

And here are the specifics 


# Features

## Existing Features 
- Interactive quizzes with immediate feedback. 
- 2 difficulty levels (easy and hard). 
- Progress tracking and scoring. 
- Responsive design for multiple devices. - Accessibility features - incl: 

## Future features
- Medium difficulty levels. 
- Subject specific levels.
- "Hint" feature - perhaps an image toggle.

# Design 


### Colour scheme 
The following colours were used to create a changing gradient glow effect on the hero image.

## UX

## Planning

### User Stories 


## Documentation 

### Code Organisation

The code in this project was organised into defined sections (including seperate files for the different languages). Files were named appropriately, consistently and (to us) obviously.



## Validation and testing 

The website is intented to be accessible to all (within reason). Therefore validation and testing of both the code and final project design was completed to ensure best practise of accessibility and user experience.

## Usage 

Fission 4 Answers is designed for recreational and educarional usage, for those who wish to test or improve their science knowledge. This is not designed to align with any curriculum. 

** Maybe include a little video/walk through tutorial if there's any time? **

# AI Tools 

AI was utilised in this project in serveral areas. 

### Debugging:

### Code Optimisation:

### Reflection on the use of AI in this project:

The use of AI has allowed this project to be created in a more timely manner. AI for **debugging** helped to identify small errors and typos which would have taken considerably longer if done by hand (or eye?).
<br>
In **code optimisation**, AI was able to suggest areas in which the code could be made shorter/more effective, and suggest alternative work-arounds for design. This was most appropriate in the CSS and HTML of the wesbite, as JavaScript information tended to be less reliable, although a useful tool nonetheless. 
<br>
Finally, AI was a useful tool in the intial planning stage, such as in the generation and optimisation of the [User Stories](#user-stories). AI was also used to suggest initial **code generation**, to give an idea of where to start - although this was not used in the final project.
